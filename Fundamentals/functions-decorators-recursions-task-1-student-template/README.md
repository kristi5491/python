## Functions. Decorators. Recursions. Task 1.
Define a function `seq_sum(sequence)` which allows to count sum of elements. Elements of all nested sequences should be included.

Example:
```python
def seq_sum(sequence):
    pass
  
sequence = [1,2,3,[4,5, (6,7)]]

>>> print(seq_sum(sequence))
28
```
}

## Functions. Decorators. Recursions. Task 2.
Define a function `linear_seq(sequence)` which converts a passed sequence to a sequence without nested sequences.

Example:
```python
def linear_seq(sequence):
    pass
  
sequence = [1,2,3,[4,5, (6,7)]]

>>> print(linear_seq(sequence))
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

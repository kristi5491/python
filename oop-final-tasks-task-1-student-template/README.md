## Final tasks. Task 1

A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. 
Implement singleton logic inside your custom class using a method to initialize class instance.

Example:

```python
>>> p = Sun.inst()
>>> f = Sun.inst()
>>> p is f
True

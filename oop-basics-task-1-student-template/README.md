## OOP Basics. Task 1
***

Develop a class `Field` with "full encapsulation", whose attributes are accessed and data changes are implemented through method calls.


In OOP, it is generally accepted to start the names of methods for extracting data with the word *"get"*,
and the names of the methods in which fields are equated to a certain value - *"set"*.

In this task, you need to implement `get_value` and `set_value` methods for `Field` class (`__value` property).

# Data Types. Final task 2

Write a program which makes a pretty print of a part of the multiplication table.

__Example__:
```
Input:
row_start = 2
row_end = 4
column_start = 3
column_end = 7

Output: [[6, 8, 10, 12, 14], [9, 12, 15, 18, 21], [12, 16, 20, 24, 28]]
that is equal to the following multiplication table:

    3   4   5   6   7   
2   6   8   10  12  14  
3   9   12  15  18  21  
4   12  16  20  24  28
